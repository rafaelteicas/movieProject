## About the project
The main idea throughout the project is to test my knowledge and develop a functional application with a nice user interface, implementing things used in almost all major applications
## Functionalities
Login using firebase with database for username and storage for profile picture.
Redux for store the state.
React Form for managing the form and yup for creating schemas.
React Navigation (Tabs and Drawer).
Axios to consume the tmdb api.
## Installing
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rafaelteicas/movieProject.git
cd movieProject
yarn | npm install
```
You will need to set up with a Firestore account, but don't worry, everything will be created automatically.
Now you can start the application, keeping in mind that it has been configured only for Android.

```bash
yarn start 
```
